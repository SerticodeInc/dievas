## What It Is

`dievas_gallery` is a Widget book app. It is not shipped to users — it is the interactive developer tool for inspecting every Dievas component across all variants, sizes, and states.

Every exported component in `dievas` has four use-cases:

- **Playground** — full knobs panel (style, size, shape, state, icons, label)
- **All Styles** — one instance per style variant, side by side
- **All Sizes** — one instance per size value
- **All States** — one instance per state (disabled rendered via `onPressed: null`)

## Custom Addons

### `DievasThemeAddon`

Wraps every use-case canvas in the full `DievasScope` + `DievasTheme` + Material bridge. Passing `setting.data` to both `lightTheme` and `darkTheme` bypasses `DievasScope`'s internal brightness detection — the addon dropdown is the sole light/dark toggle.

Without this addon, `context.colors` returns nothing — `DievasTheme.of(context)` finds no ancestor and throws. Standard `ThemeAddon<T>` only injects Material theming.

### `ComponentBoundaryAddon`

Toggle-able hot pink 1dp border overlay that shows the exact hit box of any component wrapped in a `ComponentBoundary`. Zero component-level code changes — `ComponentBoundaryScope` propagates the flag through the tree.
